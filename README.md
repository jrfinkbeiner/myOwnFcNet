# myOwnFcNet

A very basic (and slow) implementation of a fully-connected multi-layer feed-forward neural network based on numpy, optionally with performance incereases using numba.

To use it please add the directory to your PYTHONPATH. 

For a quick example for image classification using the MNIST-dataset just run `MNIST_myFcNet.py`. The MNIST-dataset currently is loaded via tensorflow. Training one epoch will take approximately 1-2min.
